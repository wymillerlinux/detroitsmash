# detroitsmash
My homebrew custom made ansible files

There's a reason behind the name which I will tell you later!

## What is this for, anyway?

This repository is for me practicing my Ansible-fu. Don't know what Ansible is?
Ansible is an automation and provisioing platform where you write "Ansible scripts"
(actually called Ansible roles and playbooks) as YAML files and run them against
the Ansible program to have certain workstations and/or servers provisioned and
to go. This link [here](https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works) will
give a better explaination of what Ansible is and how it works.

## Installation

You can install Ansible by installing through Python's `pip` package manager:
`pip install ansible`

## Running

Coming soon (tm)

## Troubleshooting

## Naming scheme

I watch this anime called My Hero Academia and there's this phrase that goes to
the beginning of the show called Detroit Smash. That phrase fits this repo because
it ties together all of the tedious IT tasks, like the phrase comes from. You'll
get the reference if you watch the show.
